    "# Kili Tutorial: Importing predictions\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show how to import predictions (pre-annotations) into Kili in order to help annotators and accelerate the whole annotation process. The goal of this tutorial is to illustrate some basic components and concepts of Kili in a simple way, but also to dive into the actual process of iteratively developing real applications in Kili.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally:\n",
    "\n",
    "For an overview of Kili, visit kili-technology.com You can also check out the Kili documentation https://kili-technology.github.io/kili-docs. Our goal is to export labels that can predict whether an image contains a Porsche or a Tesla.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is divided into four parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding the different types of labels\n",
    "2. Understanding the data model of a label\n",
    "3. Pushing predictions to Kili\n",
    "4. Visualizing predictions in Kili\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Understanding the different types of labels\n",
    "A label is the annotation or combination of all annotations created on an asset. For example, all houses identified on the satellite image, or all the information annotated text on the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three categories of labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **default**: an ordinary label, made by an annotator\n",
    "- **prediction**: a pre-annotation, made by a model\n",
    "- **review**: a check, carried out by a reviewer\n",
    "\n",
    "When you export data (see [How to export labels](https://github.com/kili-technology/kili-playground/blob/master/recipes/export_labels.ipynb)), you can find out which category a label belongs to by looking at the field `labelType`. It can take the following values: `PREDICTION`, `DEFAULT`, `REVIEW`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Understanding the data model of a label\n",
    "Predictions under push in Kili in the form of python dictionaries. The format of the dictionary to be pushed depends on the type of data (text, image, audio), the machine learning task(s) the project is about (e.g. simple, multiple classification, transcription, named entity recognition, object detection, etc.) and their order. In summary, it depends on the JSON format that describes the interface of your annotation project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell shows you how to view this JSON. You need to update the credentials `email`, `password` and `project_id` before."

    "We introduced the concept of Kili interface settings and the 3 different kind of labels (`DEFAULT`, `PREDICTION`, `REVIEW`).
